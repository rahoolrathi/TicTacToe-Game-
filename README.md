How to Play
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is simple to play. To win, a player must place three X's or three O's in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

In the user to user mode, the first player will place an X, followed by the second player who will place an O, and so on until the game ends.

In the user to computer mode, the player will place an X, and the computer will place an O. The computer AI has been programmed to provide a challenging opponent for the player.

Technology Used

This Tic-Tac-Toe game has been built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which provides better separation of concerns between the data, UI, and logic layers of the application. The UI has been built using WPF, which provides a rich set of controls and data binding capabilities.
